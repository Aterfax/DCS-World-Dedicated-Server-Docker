# DCS-World-Dedicated-Server-Docker Troubleshooting

## The server won't start?

If this is the first time you've started the server and you have not logged in yet, you will need to login, but the login window will be hidden behind the DCS splash screen. Right click on the Login window in the task bar and click move. It should now be visible for you to login to.

It's recommended to save your credentials and enable autologin to avoid this confusion in future.

If your server is still not starting, have you installed at least 1 terrain module? Make sure you have at least 1 installed or the server will be unable to load and run any mission files.
